/*
 CSS Serializer for Cocoa Writer Generated Files
 
 Copy and Paste code from Xcode into TextEdit or Pages
 Save it as a Web Page .html document
 
 place the document in your home folder
 rename it to swift.html
 then run this swift code
 
 This will make each CSS Class unique to the file
 allowing the resulting HTML to be included
 with other snippets on the same page
