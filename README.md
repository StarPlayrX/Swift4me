https://swift4.me is a code snippet side for Swift Programmers

My site uses its own Web UI framework called MeshUI.

It is built out of pure ES6 JavaScript, CSS and HTML5.

The page is built dynamically using HTTP requests and requires an HTTP Web Server (of your choice).

I use Perfect 4 Server Side Swift web server but any HTTP will do.
